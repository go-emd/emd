		<h4>- Go Language: EMbarrassingly Distributed</h4>

		<!-- Description -->
		<h3>Methodologies</h3>
		<p>
            Go-EMD contains three major components that are implemented in order to run the distribution
            successfully.  These components are the Worker, Leader, and Connector.  With all of these components
            implemented correctly the distribution will be optimal and DRY.
        </p>

		<h3>Distribution</h3>
		<p>
			<img src="/emd/images/EMD_DIST.png" />
			<p>
                Above is a diagram of a typical distribution implementing the Go-EMD framework with more than one
                machine in the distribution.  It shows a minimal amount of connections and what the REST endpoints
                look like for a GUI to interface with it.
            </p>
		</p>

		<h3>Leader</h3>
		<p>
		    <p>
                There is one and only one leader on each machine in the distribution.  This is because one leader handles
                all REST endpoints and manages each worker on its machine.  Upon starting a leader all of its workers will
                be automatically started.  Then the leader will monitor the workers and keep a running cache of each
                worker' state, health, metrics, and last time updated.  Below is how a leader is implemented and the REST
                endpoints that can be used.

            <p>
                Above is a diagram showing visually how a leader will manage its workers and process requests for
                either worker status, health, stop, and start.  Along with other commands available.

            <p>
                Here are some helpful code references in order to implement a leader.

                </ul>
            </p>
		</p>

		<h3>Worker</h3>
		<p>
			<p>
                Implements the worker interface and are the routines that do the actual computing within the distribution.
                Generally speaking a single distribution will consist of a Source (inputs data into the distribution), a
                Worker of some sort (thought of as a bolt in Apache's Storm), and a Sink (a way of saving data created or
                minimized).
            </p>
            <img src="/emd/images/EMD_WORKER.png" />
            <p>
                Above is a diagram showing visually how a worker will work in most cases (dependant on distribution
                specific implementations).  Workers are the go routines that do that actually work/processing on the
                problem set.  Generally speaking each worker will have an input an output and will always have
                another connection to the leader known as the management connection (MGMT).  More on connectors are
                available below.

                Here are some helpful code references in order to implement a worker.

            </p>

		<h3>Connector</h3>
		<p>
            <p>
                There are a couple types of connectors, and a few more that could be implemented in
                the future.  The purpose of the connector is to simply connect workers to each other.
                They each implement the connector interface and require a channel for ingress types
                and a channel for egress types.  Below are a list of the current connector
                implementations and how they work.
            </p>
            <!--<img src="/emd/images/EMD_CONNECTOR.png" />-->
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Local:</b>  Translates to a simple go channel of type
                        interface{}.  It is meant to allow duplex communication between
                        workers and can transfer any datatype.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ExternalIngress:</b>  This is more complicated.  The ExternalIngress
                        connector is made up of a channel allowing only reading operations.
                        Upon opening the connector it will open a socket for listening on from
                        any host/device.  The information sent to it must be in the gob format
                        and the connector will need to be given a type to decode the data
                        received.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>ExternalEgress:</b>  This connector is similar to the ExternalIngress
                        except for the fact that it will only write to the channel and encode
                        the data instead of decoding it.  The socket opened in this case will
                        be UDP and only send as well.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>NOTE:</b>  It is important to note that the gob format is similar to the
                google buffers encoding.  More information can be found
                <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/" target="_blank">here</a>.
